hocr_noodling
=============

Somewhat amusing hack to deal with some pretty specific hOCR output from tesseract. Word bounding boxes are treated as polygons via django/postGIS. Also includes a quick and dirty visualizer that takes as input hocr of a single page--see display/.

##### A few quirks:
We're assuming that hOCR arrives as latin-1 *despite* being labeled as utf-8. 

We're assuming the precise syntax generated by tesseract--other hOCR flavors may break this.

Because we're (ab)using postGIS's spatial model, one needs to remove any checks that our data actually fits into any known srid. At some point I should roll a custom srid, but so far it sorta works as long as you remove the constraint like this (assuming django's default naming)

	alter table documents_pageword drop constraint "enforce_srid_bbox";
